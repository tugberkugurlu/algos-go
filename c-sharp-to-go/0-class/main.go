/*

 - this shows how a value update may not propagate as expected https://play.golang.org/p/9X6AgO2CRaW
 - it doesn't matter whether the value is a pointer here, change won't have an impact: https://play.golang.org/p/Q-2y0uIRlMs
	- as seen here, even if the method signatures accept the pointer, they can still be called on the value type itself. This is super unintuitive.
 	- you can make this work by assigning the value to be updated in a nested struct, which is managed by a pointer

 - you can make this safer by ensuring that your struct is not allowed to be constructed as a value type: https://play.golang.org/p/bd-2dI1_eEx
 - note that this is still safe to pass around as it cannot be modified: https://play.golang.org/p/Y8LWzsi7jzG

 - example: Trip
    - Trip name, trip start and end time, trip members, locations to visit
    - methods:
		- Members() []string
		- Locations() []Location
		- IsDuringTrip(time time.Time) bool
		- AddMember(string name) error
		- RemoveMember(string name) error
		- IsMemberInTrip(string name) bool
		- AddLocation(loc Location) error
		- GetClosestVisitedLocations(loc Location) ([]LocationWithDistance)

	- LocationWithDistance:
		- location Location, DistanceInKM float64

	- Location:
		- name string, lat, lon float64

	--------------------------------------------------------
	### Improvements
	--------------------------------------------------------

	The slices returned from these members can be modified (e.g. members in the indcies can be mutated)
	see https://play.golang.org/p/a1mFqYxKyps
	Wouldn't this be cool? https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20443

		- Members() []string
		- Locations() []Location

	Instead of directly returning the slice, we can encapsulate it for read-only purposes, and hide the source behind
		an interface:

		- ReadOnlyLocations
			- Each(func(loc Location))
			- GetByIndex(int index) (Location, error)
			- Len() int

		- ReadOnlyMembers
			- Each(func(loc string))
			- GetByIndex(int index) (string, error)
			- Len() int

	For the below one, we don't have to abstract this away

		- GetClosestVisitedLocations(loc Location) ([]LocationWithDistance)

	--------------------------------------------------------

 - construction, and validation
 - methods

 - construction, and validation
 - methods
 - private member hiding
 - prevent uncontrolled mutability
 - pass by reference, not by value
 - static construction

 - immutability
